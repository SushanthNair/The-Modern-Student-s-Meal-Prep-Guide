The project implements a full MERN Stack. There is also a folder with only the html/css/react/node.js version(basically without the server and mongoose)

Errors we haven't been able to figure out:
Images also don't seem to load in the full stack version. Also css files don't seem to be imported so css had to be defined within each html file.
Both these problems aren't present in the server-less version.
